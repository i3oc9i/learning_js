# Learning HTML / CSS / JavaScript

This repository contains projects and exercises to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project includes a detailed README file with project specifications. The projects are designed to practice and improve front-end development skills.

The following projects are from the [100 JS Projects](https://www.100jsprojects.com/) course by [Sahand Ghavidel](https://github.com/sahandghavidel). I've modified some projects and added new ones to practice and improve my front-end development skills.

- [Rotating Image Gallery](rotating_gallery/README.md)
- [Note Taking App](notes/README.md)

# Note Taking App Project

This project involves creating a note-taking app with a sleek and modern button design. Upon clicking the button, a new note can be created and edited as needed. Double-clicking a note prompts the user to confirm deletion, and notes are saved via browser local storage to persist even after page refresh. This project covers saving and retrieving notes using JavaScript and designing a stylish and modern glassy interface with CSS.

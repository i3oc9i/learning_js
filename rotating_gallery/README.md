# Rotating Image Gallery Project

This project involves creating a captivating image gallery with rotating images and two navigation buttons. Through JavaScript, we will dynamically change the images using timers and add event listeners for smooth navigation. The CSS transform method will be utilized to rotate the images and enhance the overall aesthetic appeal. This approach will provide a dynamic and visually stunning user experience that is sure to captivate and engage visitors. With a rotation interval of three seconds and intuitive navigation buttons, users can easily explore the gallery and appreciate its visual richness.

# Double Landing Page Project

In this project, we're designing a double landing page showcasing two products: Apple and Samsung. When hovering over a product, that side becomes larger than the other. The button also has a beautiful transition and animation effect, and a background image is added to enhance visual appeal. To achieve the hover effect, we'll use JavaScript to add and remove classes that change each side's styling. This creates a visual size change when hovering over each product.
